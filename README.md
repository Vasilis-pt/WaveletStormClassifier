# CNN Classification of Geomagnetic Storms from Wavelet Spectrograms
# Geomagnetic Storm Classifier (Wavelet + CNN)

This project uses **wavelet spectrograms** of geomagnetic field data to classify days as either **storm** or **quiet** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

---

## 🌍 Motivation

Geomagnetic storms are critical space weather events that can disrupt power grids, GPS, and satellites. This project explores the feasibility of identifying storm days directly from **spectrogram images** built using time-frequency analysis (e.g., wavelet transforms).
